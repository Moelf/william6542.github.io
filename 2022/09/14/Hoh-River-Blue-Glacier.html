<p>51 miles<br />
7555 Feet Elevation Gain</p>

<p>Four days three nights backpacking trip at Olympic NPS: 
Day 1: Started at tourist infested Hoh River information center. Camped at Olympus Ranger Station Island.<br />
Day 2: Left the river and started climbing towards Elk Lake camp.<br />
Day 3: Elk Lake base camp, up and down to Blue Glacier.<br />
Day 4: Return all the way to information center.</p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>The first day was interesting, just getting to the trailhead was a pain. Crossing the sound is beautiful, but driving along the Northern Olympic peninsula is just depressing. How could urban planners and the citizens have made such a beautiful landscape so dull and clear cut? What a shame. Perhaps if one left the highway and drove deeper towards the forest or towards the ocean it would be better, but the highway itself was sad.Reaching the Olympic NPS ranger HQ station, I got my permit. The ranger was very good, and I learned I could have actually just printed it out at home. Apparently Olympic NPS allows you to do this, some of the other parks do not. Huh. Guess this really shows the importance of calling every park to learn as much as possible. After reaching the entrance to Hoh River, I had to wait another hour for the long line of tourist cars, since there was literally no parking left. Even after I got in, I had to circle around for 15 minutes until I finally found a parking spot in the backpackers’ section. Too many tourists were parking in the backpacker designated sections. There were barely enough rangers to keep order. It was a mess. In total, it took me 6 hours to get from home to the trailhead.</p>

<p>For this trip, I overloaded my equipment. Around 41lb including full water and food. I had done some strength exercises, and I was feeling much more confident. I also studied the topo maps a lot more clearly, and I spaced out the mileage/elevation gain ratio a lot better. In general, I would not be doing more than 8 miles a day, and if I was, it would be on flat trail. The entire trip was planned around sitting at the final destination for a few hours. That’s why I didn’t decide to plan a rush trip. Everything was planned so I could see the beautiful glacier, because I knew there would be clouds. The forecast indicated that the view window time was only about 11am-3pm. I had to make it that Thursday.</p>

<p>The other reason I planned the trip here instead of at Glacier Peak Wilderness, which is where I had planned to go a month earlier, was due to the intense wildfire smoke that was wafting around Seattle. My prediction was that the smoke wouldn’t be able to get deep into the peninsula, as the Hoh River was on the ocean side of the peninsula.</p>

<p>So off I went. The first part of the trail was relatively flat, and the first two hours of hiking were filled with tourists. It was a Tuesday, yet still so many people. Past Five Mile Island campground, only backpackers remained. Throughout the entire trip, until the last day, Friday, I only saw 16 backpacking groups. The trees were huge, and there were so many. The forest was wet and teeming with twisting and bouncy plant life, but I didn’t feel oppressed or too humid. The trail was well maintained, and the river was usually within hearing.</p>

<p>Huge Trees!<br />

<p>At Olympus Station Island Campground, I set up camp with three other groups of campers. We camped on a sandy outcropping, right next to the river. The water was soothing and calm. My helinox zero chair was great comfort. I ate my hot food, and sat and watched the river flow under the shadow of the twilight clouds.</p>

<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
<p>The next day I headed out at 9am, quite late. I was going to take it slow, it was 3 miles flat, and then 3.5 miles up. The way up was well marked, and the trail was fine, but it was a steep up. The wetness of the forest started to thin out, and the ground of the forest sections became more sparse. The trees became smaller, but the beauty of the forest was still there, and it was still clearly the Olympics.</p>

<p>Last place where the trail meets the base river, and then turns up:

<p>Bridge over chasm:
<img src="/assets/hoh7.jpeg" alt="Bridge" /></p>

<p>At the bridge, the sun shone through the sky. Far far away, I could see the high route Bailey Traverse going around the edge of the mountain ridge. Some day perhaps. I stayed on the bridge for 20 minutes. The water below was strong and deep, but the sound was faint. The sun was warm. The bridge wood smelled nice. My sweat was drying out. I was careful to not drop anything down. I was very scared to take photos on the bridge. At this point, two older hikers (50s) came up. I would be passing them, and they would be passing me for until we reached Elk Lake. They would be rushing the final destination by camping at the High Meadows.</p>

<p>Elk Lake is not pretty. The campground near it is also nasty. The camping area proper is tight, with lots of fallen or about to fall trees. This campground is also overcrowded. People also don’t know how to use a bear hang properly. (This is why I always use a bear can, even if not required, simply because it keeps the smell tightly hidden, and my Bearikade type can has never failed before over twenty years of production and use by other campers and professionals. Also it’s a nice stool/footrest).</p>

<p>I was distraught at having to camp with a bunch of frat bros who kept yelling and partying. So I decided to look around. Luckily I found a spot along the side of a ridge, enough for one small tent. A mom and son were camped there, and they offered the spot to me, as they had just come back from the Glacier, and were leaving. They said to me, are you going up now? It was 3pm. I said no, why rush? They smiled and said, yes, you are totally right, those frat bros who just went up are crazy, what’s the point of going up if you don’t sit and enjoy it?</p>

<p>I sat around and read The Grand Sophy. Then dinner, then sleep. During the night I heard some stomping, it was a bear. But it sniffed my tent and then left.</p>

<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>
<p>This was the day. The entire trip planned around this goal. I left at 8, leaving my tent, sleeping bag, bearcan, book, behind. I brought a lot of clothes, some snacks, and the chair. Elk Lake didn’t have good water (the lake is nasty) so I started up with only 1 liter. Luckily, just 20 minutes into the climb, there was a clean stream. I filled up to my max 4 liter capacity. The rest of the way up was just a slog. The first section along the various stream gullies and exposed areas were somewhat annoying: the ferns were overgrown and some of the gully crossings were washed out. But nothing dangerous. At one point I heard a bear, but it ran away in the ferns. Finally, I arrived at the ridgeline, which was very sketch. The trail was only two feet wide, and the drop was steep and long. Along the ridge I met an old lady (60s?) who was zooming! There were also some incredible views here. Then came the big danger: the ladder of doom.</p>

<p>From the sketch ridge, looking towards Mt Tom and White Glacier:

<p>Ladder of Doom:
<img src="/assets/hoh10.jpeg" alt="Ladder of doom" /></p>

<p>This was the ladder that the ranger warned about. I had brought tactical gloves specifically for it. It was a very steep, 45 degree, maybe more, descent down a dirt gully, 100 feet. The area had washed out in a massive flood/mudslide more than 15 years ago. I slid down the gully, while keeping my left hand on the ladder wire. My pants got very dirty and so did my bag. But I made it. My body took no damage. It was quite dangerous, but also very exciting. I felt like my skill and mental steadfastness were paying off. My planning was working. And in any case, I knew I had to make it. There was no turning back. If I turned back, how could I live up to myself? If two old men could make it, if an old lady could make it, then I had to make it. I had already come 20 miles deep into the forest, I had to go to the end. So I did. As I climbed back up the other side, the two old men who I was thinking of as encouragement suddenly appeared! They said, you made it across! Yes I did.</p>

<p>The section through the Meadows campground was quick. I reached the exposed rock line. This was the final trail up to the glacier moraine ridge. It was tough. An hour of up. But my body wasn’t in pain. I made it up quickly. It got windier and windier. It got colder and colder. Then I crested the final ridge. No, it couldn’t be. It was there. It was beautiful. It was unlike anything I’d ever seen. I was in tears, cried like I don’t know since when. But tears of joy, and the emptiness now gone. My first multi day long backpacking trip, and all alone! All alone, all alone! No one to cover for me, no one to boost my morale, no one else to talk to. There was no one else on the ridge. How can I describe that feeling, the feeling of having made it to such a terrific and beautiful and deathly place, yet also a place that was home beyond home? There, the Olympic Mountains, and Blue Glacier, snow and clouds, in front of me.</p>

<p>Blue Glacier:

<p>Snow Dome:
<img src="/assets/hoh19.jpeg" alt="dome" /></p>

<p>Towards the Blue Valley: 
<img src="/assets/hoh18.jpeg" alt="valley" /></p>

<p>I walked to the end of the ridge, and set up my viewing outpost. The clouds darted in and out, and from 11:45am-2pm I had beautiful shifting views of the namesake of the Olympics. The wind was cold cold cold, so I put on all my layers. And it was still cold. I took so many photos, too many haha. I peeked around at everything with my 8*25 Steiner compact binoculars. The time passed and passed, but there was no time for me. Only now.</p>

<p>Finally the clouds rolled in and at 2:15pm two mountaineers, Brian of Mt Baker and Chabert? of Moab appeared. They said to me, oh, we thought we were alone. I said, well you are not now. They asked me how long I had been there. Since 11am. Wow. Do you have photos of the glacier? Yea, here. They took photos of my photos, and then thanked me. They descended down the ridge into the deep scree and glacial rock, using my photos as routefinding. At this point, around 3:00pm, Cameron and his dad Bob, and another person whose name I forget, came by. Have you just been sitting here all day? Pointing at my chair. Since 11. Oh man you’ve been here a while huh, Was it this cloudy all day? No, it was clear for about 2 and a half hours. Oh man we missed it huh? Yes, but I have photos. Wow.</p>

<p>So the four of us sat and watched Brian and Chabert clamber over the glacier, trying to guess what route they would take. Bob predicted the routes accurately, and he joked that he should go take a mountaineering class. He really wanted to do it. I didn’t think they would actually go on the glacier, given that it was already in mid afternoon, and also the clouds had rolled in fully, and that just before they went on the glacier there was a massive 15 second long thundering of falling rock and ice. But Brian and Chabert did it.</p>

<p>Remember to talk about the bears on Night 3, and the pot banging at midnight because people had to scare the bears away.</p>

<p>THIS STORY IS UNFINISHED. WORK IN PROGESS.</p>
