51 miles  
7555 Feet Elevation Gain

Four days three nights backpacking trip at Olympic NPS: 
Day 1: Started at tourist infested Hoh River information center. Camped at Olympic Ranger Station.  
Day 2: Left the river and started climbing towards Elk Lake camp.  
Day 3: Elk Lake base camp, up and down to Blue Glacier.  
Day 4: Return all the way to information center. 

## Day 1  
The first day was interesting, just getting to the trailhead was a pain. Crossing the sound is beautiful, but driving along the Northern Olympic peninsula is just depressing. How could urban planners and the citizens have made such a beautiful landscape so dull and clear cut? What a shame. Reaching the Olympic NPS ranger HQ station, I got my permit. The ranger was very good, and I learned I could have actually just printed it out at home. Apparently Olympic NPS allows you to do this, some of the other parks do not. Huh. Guess this really shows the importance of calling every park to learn as much as possible. After reaching the entrance to Hoh River, I had to wait another hour for the long line of tourist cars, since there was literally no parking left. Even after I got in, I had to circle around for 15 minutes until I finally found a parking spot in the backpackers' section. Too many tourists were parking in the backpacker designated sections. There were barely enough rangers to keep order. It was a mess. In total, it took me 6 hours to get from home to the trailhead. 

For this trip, I overloaded my equipment. I had done some strength exercises, and I was feeling much more confident. I also studied the topo maps a lot more clearly, and I spaced out the mileage/elevation gain ratio a lot better. In general, I would not be doing more than 8 miles a day, and if I was, it would be on flat trail. The entire trip was planned around sitting at the final destination for a few hours. That's why I didn't decide to plan a rush trip. Everything was planned so I could see the beautiful glacier, because I knew there would be clouds. The forecast indicated that the view window time was only about 11am-3pm. I had to make it. 

So off I went.
