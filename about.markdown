Hi, I'm William. This website is an attempt to control my own information, but at the same time to share it with my future self, and others who wish to see who I am. 

On this website I will include many things, but the common theme will be that they are created by me. Whether it be book reviews, analyses of geopolitics, hike trip reports, camera or film photos, gear reviews, film reccomendations, music lists, and so on. 

I currently live somewhere along the I-5. 

This website shall be a bridge between the private and the public, a bridge between digital and physical, a bridge between old and new. Perhaps it will provide you with a view not seen before. 

All writing and images here are property and copyright of William Wu. Any links to other websites are not overseen by me, unless otherwise noted.
